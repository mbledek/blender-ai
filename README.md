# Blender AI
This is a simple DIY smart assistant that I've decided to create when I stumbled upon Tacotron2. I thought that it would be extremely fun and interesting to create a smart assistant with a voice that I want. That's when Blender AI came to life. This is my first upload and the first public version of Blender AI, but I haven't prepared any instructions to install it yourself YET. 

# What it can do
Right now Blender AI can:
- depict what your're saying
- search Wikipedia with what you've asked
- search Google with what you've asked
- tell you a random joke
- tell you a random fact
- respond to what you've said according to a pre-written dictionary
- check your local network and tell you if there are any new (or gone) devices
- check your email and play all audio attachments and generate voice from a specified mail
- and of course, verbally tell you all the things above with a voice of your choice

Work in progress:
- Spotify control (play, pause, previous, next)
- implementing Cleverbot
- weather

# To do
- release an English version
- make a tutorial/instructions to a full install
- make a few long-term tests and improve the code
- release a version of Blender AI for computers without CUDA cores
- release a version of Blender AI for Raspberry PI
- expand the dictionary with pre-written responses

# Future goals and plans
My future goals for this project are to:
- make this code as clear as possible
- make this code easy to expand with your own modules
- use Blender AI as an actual smart assistant with IoT interactions:
- control of lights
- control of other IoT devices
- control of my other projects (possibly IoT robots)
- control old devices with IR controls
